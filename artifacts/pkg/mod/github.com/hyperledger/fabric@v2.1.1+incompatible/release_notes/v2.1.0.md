v2.1.0 Release Notes - April 15, 2020
=====================================

What's New in Hyperledger Fabric v2.1
-------------------------------------

**FAB-17357: Add endorser metric for simulation failure**

Added metric endorser_proposal_simulation_failures.

**FAB-14761: Limit concurrent requests to endorser and deliver services**

Limits can now be placed on the number of endorser and deliver requests
that a peer will process at any one time. If a peer is already processing its
limit of requests, subsequent requests in excess of the limit will return an error,
and the client will need to retry the call. The limits are configured using the
following core.yaml properties:
- peer.limits.concurrency.endorserService
- peer.limits.concurrency.deliverService

**FAB-17463: Allow peer to override implicit collection dissemination properties**

The following config properties have been added to peer's core.yaml
for implicit private data collection dissemination:
- peer.gossip.pvtData.ImplicitCollectionDisseminationPolicy.requiredPeerCount
- peer.gossip.pvtData.ImplicitCollectionDisseminationPolicy.maxPeerCount

When a peer endorses a transaction that writes to its own organization's
implicit private data collection, the new properties will dictate how
many other peers in the organization the endorsing peer will attempt to
disseminate to (maxPeerCount), and how many peers must acknowledge receipt
of the private data before endorsement succeeds (requiredPeerCount).
These properties are applicable to all channels the peer has joined. The implication
is that requiredPeerCount has to be smaller than the number of peers in a channel
that has the lowest numbers of peers from the organization.

**FAB-17279: Support collection level endorsement policies for discovery**

v2.0 added an option to specify an endorsement policy at a chaincode's private
data collection level. Service discovery now supports this feature when the
collection name is passed to the discovery endorsers query.

**Discover CLI now supports SEC 1 formatted private keys**
Private keys that are generated with openssl ecparam (SEC 1 format) are now supported
with the discover CLI, in addition to the PKCS8 private keys that were already supported.

**Dependency updates**

- Bump docker images to Alpine 3.11.
- Bump Go to 1.14.1.
- Bump Go grpc to 1.28.0.

Fixes
-----

All fixes in v2.0.1 have also been applied to v2.1.0. Additionally the following fixes have been made.

**FAB-17441: approveformyorg lifecycle command should allow update of only package ID**

approveformyorg lifecycle command now allows only the package ID to be updated.

**Fix nil dereference in etcdraft config parsing**

The etcdraft config parsing code checked that the consensus
metadata was not nil, but it failed to check that the options were not nil.
The additional nil checks have been added.

**FAB-17517: Only Initialize specified BCCSP provider**

When Fabric is built with GO_TAGS="pkcs11",
BCCSP attempted to initialize PKCS11 even when BCCSP is configured for software.
This resulted in error
"Failed to initialize local MSP: could not initialize BCCSP Factories: Failed initializing PKCS11.BCCSP"

**FAB-17672: Prevent gossip probes from registering as long lasting connections**

This fix helps to more quickly establish gossip connections when
peers are starting at the same time.

**FAB-17726: Properly handle malformed gossip envelopes**

Fix rare nil pointer panic at:
  github.com/hyperledger/fabric/gossip/comm.interceptAcks.func1(0x0)
  /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/gossip/comm/ack.go:66 +0x2e

**FAB-17725: Omit go.mod and go.sum from package when not in module mode**

In certain environments, it's possible to package chaincode that is structured
as a module from an active GOPATH. This often happens when the path provided
to the package command is an import path resolvable from the GOPATH instead of
a file system path.

If the package can successfully build in the packaging environment from the
import path, the chaincode dependencies are calculated and packaged from the
GOPATH for compilation as a traditional go package.

In this scenario where the code at the import path is structured as a module,
the go.mod would be included in the chaincode package as packaging always
includes all non-hidden files in the top level folder of the import path.

On the server, the presence of the go.mod implies that the build process
should execute in module mode. When the dependencies have been vendored in the
module, the build uses -mod=vendor flag to indicate the module requirements
should be satisfied from the vendor folder.  Unfortunately, since the
chaincode dependencies were packaged using GOPATH mode instead of module mode,
there are some metadata files missing from the vendor folder that are expected
by the module mode build process.

To help prevent this from occurring, we will explicitly omit go.mod and go.sum
from top level folder of chaincode that is not packaged in module mode.
